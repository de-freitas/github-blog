# **github-blog**!

### **About:**

"github-blog" is a simple project built as part of a [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) challenge to practice React.js. The goal is to fetch data from the GitHub API and render dynamic routes.

It was deployed on Vercel, fell free to check it out >>> https://github-blog-gold.vercel.app
